        <h2>Understanding Taniti's Customs and Laws</h2>
        <h3>Local Customs</h3>
        <p>
            Tanitians are known for their warm hospitality and rich cultural heritage. Respect for elders and community is highly valued. When visiting rural areas, it's appreciated if visitors dress modestly and greet locals with a friendly smile or nod.
        </p>
        <h3>Language</h3>
        <p>
            While many younger Tanitians speak fluent English, especially in urban areas, the native language is widely spoken. Learning a few basic phrases can enhance your experience.
